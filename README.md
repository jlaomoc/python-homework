## PyBank Assignment 

In this assignment I created a python script that anaylsis the finanical records of a company. I sourced all my data from the finanical dataset located the CSV file named budget_data.csv

My task for this assignment was the anaylsis the records and calculate the following:
 *The total number of months included   in the dataset

 *The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period

 *The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period

 *The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

 *The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
 
I was able to run these results by utilizing the cheatsheets provided by to us by Huan. As well as, him explaining what to do with the assignment.
